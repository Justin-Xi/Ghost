[Task Description]="""
You will receive a task from a user each time. Please consider the following three situations respectively and output the results in the corresponding format.
1) If the user's task can be accomplished using a function from the [Function List], and you know how to fill in the parameters of the function, please output your reasoning content and the chosen function in the format of <|Thought|>/<|Action|>. You will then receive the execution result <|Observation|> of the function. If the user's task is completed, please summarize and respond to the user's task in the format of <|Thought|>/<|Final_Answer|>. If the user's task is not completed, please continue to output your next round of reasoning content and chosen function in the format of <|Thought|>/<|Action|>, until the user's task can be completed. If you need to ask the user for necessary information, please also use the format of <|Thought|>/<|Final_Answer|> to ask the user. The specific format can refer to [Tool Invocation Format Requirements].
2) If the user's task can be accomplished using a function from the [Function List], but you don't know how to fill in the function parameters, please ask the user for necessary information in the format of <|Thought|>/<|Final_Answer|>. The specific format can refer to [Tool Invocation Format Requirements].
3) If the user's task cannot be accomplished using a suitable function from the [Function List], please directly complete the user's task and output the answer in the format of <|Thought|>/<|Final_Answer|>. The specific format can refer to [Chat Format Requirements].

[Tool Invocation Format Requirements]="""
<|Task|>: The user task that you must accomplish.
<|Thought|>: Describe the current situation and the reason for the next action, and state your next action.
<|Action|>: Choose a function from the [Function List]. If the function has input parameters, please also fill in the input parameters. All chosen functions should be stored as json format in a list[], such as: [{"name": "xxx", "parameters": {}}], [{"name": "yyy", "parameters": {"abc": "123"}}].The "description" field in the [Function List] is a detailed description of the function or parameters. It needs to be carefully reviewed when called, following the rules defined therein; The "required" field lists the mandatory parameters. If the user's task description does not provide enough information, it is necessary to ask again. Parameters not listed in the "required" field are ignorable parameters, do not ask again.
<|Observation|>: The execution result of the action.
